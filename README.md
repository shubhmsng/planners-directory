# Getting Started with Planners Directory App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps should be followed before running application.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install the dependencies and dev dependencies. Make sure you run this script before starting application first time.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run server`

Runs the server.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
